You are building a string s of length n one character at a time, prepending each new character to the front of the string. The strings are labeled from 1 to n, where the string with length i is labeled si.

For example, for s = "abaca", s1 == "a", s2 == "ca", s3 == "aca", etc.
The score of si is the length of the longest common prefix between si and sn (Note that s == sn).

Given the final string s, return the sum of the score of every si.



Example 1:

Input: s = "babab"
Output: 9
Explanation:
For s1 == "b", the longest common prefix is "b" which has a score of 1.
For s2 == "ab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s3 == "bab", the longest common prefix is "bab" which has a score of 3.
For s4 == "abab", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s5 == "babab", the longest common prefix is "babab" which has a score of 5.
The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.
Example 2:

Input: s = "azbazbzaz"
Output: 14
Explanation:
For s2 == "az", the longest common prefix is "az" which has a score of 2.
For s6 == "azbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azb" which has a score of 3.
For s9 == "azbazbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azbazbzaz" which has a score of 9.
For all other si, the score is 0.
The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
