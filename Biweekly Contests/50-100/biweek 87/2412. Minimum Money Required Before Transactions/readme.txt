You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array transactions, where transactions[i] = [costi, cashbacki].

The array describes transactions, where each transaction must be completed exactly once in some order. At any given moment, you have a certain amount of money. In order to complete transaction i, money >= costi must hold true. After performing a transaction, money becomes money - costi + cashbacki.

Return the minimum amount of money required before any transaction so that all of the transactions can be completed regardless of the order of the transactions.



Example 1:

Input: transactions = [[2,1],[5,0],[4,2]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
Starting with money = 10, the transactions can be performed in any order.
It can be shown that starting with money < 10 will fail to complete all transactions in some order.
Example 2:

Input: transactions = [[3,0],[0,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- If transactions are in the order [[3,0],[0,3]], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 3.
- If transactions are in the order [[0,3],[3,0]], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 0.
Thus, starting with money = 3, the transactions can be performed in any order.


Constraints:

1 <= transactions.length <= 105
transactions[i].length == 2
0 <= costi, cashbacki <= 109
