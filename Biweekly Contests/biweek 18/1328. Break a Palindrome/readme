Given a palindromic string palindrome, replace exactly one character by any lowercase English letter so that the string becomes the lexicographically smallest possible string that isn't a palindrome.

After doing so, return the final string.  If there is no way to do so, return the empty string.



Example 1:

Input: palindrome = "abccba"
Output: "aaccba"
Example 2:

Input: palindrome = "a"
Output: ""


Constraints:

1 <= palindrome.length <= 1000
palindrome consists of only lowercase English letters.
