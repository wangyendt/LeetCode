You are given an integer array nums. The value of this array is defined as the sum of |nums[i]-nums[i+1]| for all 0 <= i < nums.length-1.

You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You can perform this operation only once.

Find maximum possible value of the final array.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: By reversing the subarray [3,1,5] the array becomes [2,5,1,3,4] whose value is 10.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,9,24,2,1,10]
Output: 68


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3*10^4
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
