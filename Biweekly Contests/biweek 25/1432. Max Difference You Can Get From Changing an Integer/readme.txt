You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two times:

Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x.
Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0.
Let a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and second times, respectively.

Return the max difference between a and b.



Example 1:

Input: num = 555
Output: 888
Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888
Example 2:

Input: num = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8
Example 3:

Input: num = 123456
Output: 820000
Example 4:

Input: num = 10000
Output: 80000
Example 5:

Input: num = 9288
Output: 8700


Constraints:

1 <= num <= 10^8
