Given a sorted list of disjoint intervals, each interval intervals[i] = [a, b] represents the set of real numbers x such that a <= x < b.

We remove the intersections between any interval in intervals and the interval toBeRemoved.

Return a sorted list of intervals after all such removals.



Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[0,2],[3,4],[5,7]], toBeRemoved = [1,6]
Output: [[0,1],[6,7]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[0,5]], toBeRemoved = [2,3]
Output: [[0,2],[3,5]]


Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^9
