A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:

The number of nodes is nodes;
The value of the i-th node is value[i];
The parent of the i-th node is parent[i].
Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.



Example 1:



Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
Output: 2


Constraints:

1 <= nodes <= 10^4
-10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5
parent.length == nodes
parent[0] == -1 which indicates that 0 is the root.
