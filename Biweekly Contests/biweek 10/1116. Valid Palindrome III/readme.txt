Given a string s and an integer k, find out if the given string is a K-Palindrome or not.

A string is K-Palindrome if it can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most k characters from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdeca", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Remove 'b' and 'e' characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s has only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= s.length
