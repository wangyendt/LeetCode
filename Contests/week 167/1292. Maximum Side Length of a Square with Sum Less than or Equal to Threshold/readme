Given a m x n matrix mat and an integer threshold. Return the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to threshold or return 0 if there is no such square.



Example 1:


Input: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], threshold = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum side length of square with sum less than 4 is 2 as shown.
Example 2:

Input: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2]], threshold = 1
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], threshold = 6
Output: 3
Example 4:

Input: mat = [[18,70],[61,1],[25,85],[14,40],[11,96],[97,96],[63,45]], threshold = 40184
Output: 2


Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 300
m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10000
0 <= threshold <= 10^5
