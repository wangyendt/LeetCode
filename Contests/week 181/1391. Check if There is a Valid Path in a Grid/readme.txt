Given a m x n grid. Each cell of the grid represents a street. The street of grid[i][j] can be:
1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.


You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell (0,0). A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell (0,0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1). The path should only follow the streets.

Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.

Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.



Example 1:


Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).
Example 4:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]
Output: true
Example 5:

Input: grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]
Output: true


Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6
