You are given a binary string s, and a 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [firsti, secondi].

For the ith query, find the shortest substring of s whose decimal value, val, yields secondi when bitwise XORed with firsti. In other words, val ^ firsti == secondi.

The answer to the ith query is the endpoints (0-indexed) of the substring [lefti, righti] or [-1, -1] if no such substring exists. If there are multiple answers, choose the one with the minimum lefti.

Return an array ans where ans[i] = [lefti, righti] is the answer to the ith query.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.



Example 1:

Input: s = "101101", queries = [[0,5],[1,2]]
Output: [[0,2],[2,3]]
Explanation: For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is "101" which has a decimal value of 5, and 5 ^ 0 = 5, hence the answer to the first query is [0,2]. In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is "11", and has a decimal value of 3, and 3 ^ 1 = 2. So, [2,3] is returned for the second query.

Example 2:

Input: s = "0101", queries = [[12,8]]
Output: [[-1,-1]]
Explanation: In this example there is no substring that answers the query, hence [-1,-1] is returned.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1", queries = [[4,5]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: For this example, the substring in range [0,0] has a decimal value of 1, and 1 ^ 4 = 5. So, the answer is [0,0].


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= queries.length <= 105
0 <= firsti, secondi <= 109
