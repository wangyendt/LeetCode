Given an integer array queries and a positive integer intLength, return an array answer where answer[i] is either the queries[i]th smallest positive palindrome of length intLength or -1 if no such palindrome exists.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.



Example 1:

Input: queries = [1,2,3,4,5,90], intLength = 3
Output: [101,111,121,131,141,999]
Explanation:
The first few palindromes of length 3 are:
101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 201, ...
The 90th palindrome of length 3 is 999.
Example 2:

Input: queries = [2,4,6], intLength = 4
Output: [1111,1331,1551]
Explanation:
The first six palindromes of length 4 are:
1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, and 1551.


Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= queries[i] <= 109
1 <= intLength <= 15
