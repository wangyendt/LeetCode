Return the result of evaluating a given boolean expression, represented as a string.

An expression can either be:

"t", evaluating to True;
"f", evaluating to False;
"!(expr)", evaluating to the logical NOT of the inner expression expr;
"&(expr1,expr2,...)", evaluating to the logical AND of 2 or more inner expressions expr1, expr2, ...;
"|(expr1,expr2,...)", evaluating to the logical OR of 2 or more inner expressions expr1, expr2, ...
 

Example 1:

Input: expression = "!(f)"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: expression = "|(f,t)"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: expression = "&(t,f)"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: expression = "|(&(t,f,t),!(t))"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= expression.length <= 20000
expression[i] consists of characters in {'(', ')', '&', '|', '!', 't', 'f', ','}.
expression is a valid expression representing a boolean, as given in the description.
