A boomerang is a set of 3 points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

Given a list of three points in the plane, return whether these points are a boomerang.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
 

Note:

points.length == 3
points[i].length == 2
0 <= points[i][j] <= 100
