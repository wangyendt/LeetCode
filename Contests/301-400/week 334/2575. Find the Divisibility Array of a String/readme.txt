You are given a 0-indexed string word of length n consisting of digits, and a positive integer m.

The divisibility array div of word is an integer array of length n such that:

div[i] = 1 if the numeric value of word[0,...,i] is divisible by m, or
div[i] = 0 otherwise.
Return the divisibility array of word.



Example 1:

Input: word = "998244353", m = 3
Output: [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0]
Explanation: There are only 4 prefixes that are divisible by 3: "9", "99", "998244", and "9982443".
Example 2:

Input: word = "1010", m = 10
Output: [0,1,0,1]
Explanation: There are only 2 prefixes that are divisible by 10: "10", and "1010".


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
word.length == n
word consists of digits from 0 to 9
1 <= m <= 109
