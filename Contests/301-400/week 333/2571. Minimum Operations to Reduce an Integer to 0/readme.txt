You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any number of times:

Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.
Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.

A number x is power of 2 if x == 2i where i >= 0.



Example 1:

Input: n = 39
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
- Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
- Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.
Example 2:

Input: n = 54
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 21 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
- Add 23 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
- Subtract 26 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
So the minimum number of operations is 3.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
