Given two positive integers left and right, find the two integers num1 and num2 such that:

left <= nums1 < nums2 <= right .
nums1 and nums2 are both prime numbers.
nums2 - nums1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.
Return the positive integer array ans = [nums1, nums2]. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum nums1 value or [-1, -1] if such numbers do not exist.

A number greater than 1 is called prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.



Example 1:

Input: left = 10, right = 19
Output: [11,13]
Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
Example 2:

Input: left = 4, right = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.


Constraints:

1 <= left <= right <= 106
