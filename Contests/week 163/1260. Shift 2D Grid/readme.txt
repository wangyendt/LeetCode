Given a 2D grid of size n * m and an integer k. You need to shift the grid k times.

In one shift operation:

Element at grid[i][j] becomes at grid[i][j + 1].
Element at grid[i][m - 1] becomes at grid[i + 1][0].
Element at grid[n - 1][m - 1] becomes at grid[0][0].
Return the 2D grid after applying shift operation k times.



Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
Output: [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[3,8,1,9],[19,7,2,5],[4,6,11,10],[12,0,21,13]], k = 4
Output: [[12,0,21,13],[3,8,1,9],[19,7,2,5],[4,6,11,10]]
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 9
Output: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]


Constraints:

1 <= grid.length <= 50
1 <= grid[i].length <= 50
-1000 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000
0 <= k <= 100
