Tip1. left < right Vs left <= right

Check all my solution, I keep using left < right.
The easy but important approach:
follow and upvote my codes,
try to do the same.
you'll find all binary search is similar,
never bother thinking it anymore.

Tip2. mid = (left + right + 1) / 2 Vs mid = (left + right) / 2

mid = (left + right) / 2 to find first element valid
left = mid + 1
right = mid

mid = (left + right + 1) / 2 to find last element valid
left = mid
right = mid - 1
